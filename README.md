# specfiles
Specfiles for RPMs not found where I need them (often missing from EPEL) or personal/custom stuff.

The spec files themselves (foo.spec) are MIT licensed as per the [Fedora Guidelines](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main?rd=Licensing#License_of_Fedora_SPEC_Files):

> All original Fedora contributions are governed by the Fedora Project Contributor Agreement (FPCA). This means that unless a    spec file contains an explicit license attribution within it, it is available under the terms of the MIT license.
